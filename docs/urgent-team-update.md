# URGENT: Update GitHub Issues NOW

## Team Alpha & Team Beta

**CRITICAL ACTION REQUIRED**: You must update your GitHub issue statuses immediately!

### Why This Matters
- Project tracking is currently blind - I cannot see your progress
- Other team dependencies are unclear without status updates
- Sprint success depends on real-time visibility

### What To Do RIGHT NOW:
1. Go to your GitHub Project board
2. Update the status of EVERY task you've worked on:
   - Move completed tasks to "Done" 
   - Move current tasks to "In Progress"
   - Add comments on any blockers or issues
3. For each completed task, add a brief comment confirming completion

### Team Alpha Specific:
- I see orchestrator_assistant.py has been implemented with full decide_next_action() logic (α-5 DONE!)
- Update issues α-1 through α-5 as completed
- Update current task status (likely α-6 or beyond)

### Team Beta Specific:
- Update infrastructure setup progress (β-1 through β-3)
- **REMINDER**: GCS credentials handoff at 12:15 is CRITICAL

### Going Forward:
- Update issues AS SOON AS you complete/start a task
- Add comments if you encounter ANY blockers
- Use labels like "blocked", "help-wanted" if needed

This is not optional - sprint success depends on visibility!
